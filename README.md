# Hey there! 👋

I'm José, a self-taught developer and engineering studend with a passion for web development.

📚 I began styding at a technical school specializing in IT and networks, where I gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JS  and also learnt the basics of CS using C++ and python.
Although frontend development is my main focus, I'm intrigued by backend technologies and experiment with databases and configure servers in the future.

👨‍💻 Through internships at a web development company, I got a deeper understanding of frontend. You can watch my frontend demos and some other projects.

I also love ☕️ and 🐱.

Feel free to get in touch.
